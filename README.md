# Contact 
You can contact me at [R. Bajon](mailto:raphael.bajon@ifremer.fr?subject=[GitHub]%20Carbon-progress%20Folder) about the EGU2023 presentation, work in this folder or possible collaboration. 

# carbon-progress
This folder will give an overview of the codes and data used to compute carbon plots from work I have been doing on carbon transport.

## EGU presentation 

The presentation done at the EGU 2023 (once it is finished) is available [here](presentation/EGU2023-carbon-bajonr.pdf). If you want also to do similar work/draw figures as in this powerpoint file, please do not hesitate to ask.

## Package (not yet finalised)

I am currently working on a simple python library to do statistics and plot cruise data such as for the Go-Ship A25 OVIDE section (for special features, please contact me).
